### MIMO
 -> It is the method of multiplying the capacity of the radio link using multiple transmission and receiving antennas to exploit multi-path propagation 
 -> It has become an important element of wireless communication standard which includes 
 

### Band Steering 
-> Routers at home with 4 antennas can support 2.4GHz and 5GHz when a device is connected on 5GHz bandwidth and moves away from the router signal, the 2.4GHz frequency will connect to the device automatically when you disconnect it from the 5GHz channel.
